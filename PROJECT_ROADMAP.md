# Plant Care AI - Project Roadmap

## Overview
An AI-powered mobile application for plant identification, disease detection, and care recommendations, with a focus on gardening plants and cannabis cultivation in mountainous regions like Colorado.

## Phase 1: Foundations & Tech Stack
### 1.1 Technology Selection
- [ ] Update core dependencies to latest stable versions
  - Python 3.11+
  - TensorFlow 2.x (evaluate TFLite/ONNX for mobile optimization)
  - Flutter for the mobile front-end
  - FastAPI for the backend and ML inference service
  - Streamlit (optional) for quick internal demos and model evaluation  
- [ ] Database selection
  - PostgreSQL for relational data
  - MongoDB for image/unstructured data storage
- [ ] Cloud infrastructure setup (AWS/GCP)

### 1.2 Architecture Design
- [ ] Design microservices architecture
  - Authentication service  (user management, OAuth, roles/permissions)
  - ML inference service (serving the plant classification & disease detection model)
  - Plant tracking service  (logging watering/fertilizing/pruning events, images, growth progress)
  - Weather integration service (forecast data, location-based recommendations)
  - Community/social service  (forums, achievements, expert interactions)
- [ ] Design database schemas
  - Relational tables for users, plants, plant events, community posts, etc.
  - Unstructured storage for images and any large data logs
- [ ] API specification documentation
   - Document all REST endpoints (or consider GraphQL if desired)
   - Detail request/response schemas for each service
- [ ] Mobile app wireframes
   - Basic flow: Splash → Login → Plant Scanner → Dashboard → Care Tracking → Community

## Phase 2: Core Plant Identification & Disease Detection
### 2.1 Model Architecture
- [ ] Evaluate and select model architecture
  - Evaluate EfficientNet, MobileNetV3, and potentially Vision Transformers for accuracy vs. resource usage
  - Benchmark performance/accuracy tradeoffs
  - Target >95% accuracy on key classes (garden plants, cannabis, common diseases)
- [ ] Multi-Label Classification (if diseases and deficiencies can co-occur)
  - Plan for expansions (pests + nutrient deficiency in the same plant)

### 2.2 Dataset Collection & Preparation
- [ ] Define initial plant categories
  - Common garden vegetables
  - Herbs
  - Cannabis varieties
  - Regional plants specific to Colorado
- [ ] Data collection strategy
  - Web scraping pipeline & open-source repositories
  - Dataset curation tools & cleaning (remove duplicates, low-quality images)
  - Data augmentation pipeline (rotations, flips, color jitter) to improve generalization
- [ ] Image preprocessing pipeline
  - Standardize image resolution
  - Normalization, bounding box/cropping if needed

### 2.3 Model Training & Optimization
- [ ] Training pipeline setup
  - Scripts or notebooks for reproducible training (using TF/Keras or PyTorch)
- [ ] Model quantization/Pruning for mobile
  - Evaluate TFLite or ONNX to reduce inference time on devices
- [ ] A/B testing framework
 - Compare multiple model versions in production
- [ ] Model versioning system
  - Tag each model release (model_v1, model_v2, etc.)
  - Maintain consistent evaluation metrics

## Phase 3: Plant Care & Progress Tracking
### 3.1 Core Features
- [ ] Plant profile management
 - Create/edit/delete plant entries per user
 - Associate species/disease data with each profile
- [ ] Care event tracking
  - Watering
  - Fertilizing
  - Pruning
  - Repotting
- [ ] Growth timeline with photos
  - Storing multiple images per plant with timestamps
  - Display visual timeline (“2 weeks ago vs. today”)
- [ ] Care recommendations engine
  - Simple rules-based engine initially (e.g., “Water every X days”)
  - Expand to AI-based personalized suggestions over time

### 3.2 Mobile App Development
- [ ] UI/UX implementation
  - Flutter-based design with intuitive navigation
- [ ] Camera integration
  - Built-in flow for taking/uploading plant images
- [ ] Local storage management
  - Offline caching of user data (if no internet)
- [ ] Offline functionality
- [ ] Push notifications
  - Reminders for watering/fertilizing
  - Alerts for potential issues or next steps

## Phase 4: Community & Gamification
### 4.1 Social Features
- [ ] User profiles
  - Publicly share certain plant profiles or keep them private
- [ ] Plant sharing functionality
   - Ability to post plant progress photos in a community feed
- [ ] Community forums
   - Q&A for plant care, disease diagnosis, etc.
- [ ] Expert Verification: Tag certain users as horticulture experts
- [ ] Plant care achievements/badges

### 4.2 Gamification
- [ ] Achievement system
 - Rewards for consistent use (watering streaks), disease recovery, community help
- [ ] Progress tracking
  - Show personal improvement stats, e.g., “You’ve grown 3 healthy plants this month”
- [ ] Community challenges
  - “Grow a perfect tomato plant” or “Best cannabis harvest”
- [ ] Expert ranking system
   - Points/votes from community to recognize top contributors

## Phase 5: Weather Integration
- [ ] Weather API integration
  - Evaluate OpenWeather, WeatherAPI, or AccuWeather
  - Daily/weekly forecast retrieval for user’s location
- [ ] Location-based recommendations
  - Automatic or manual location input
  - “High chance of frost: Protect your plants” notifications
- [ ] Automated care adjustments
  - Reduce watering recommendations if rain is forecasted
- [ ] Weather alerts system
  - Push notifications for severe weather events

## Phase 6: Security & User Management
- [ ] OAuth implementation
  - Google
  - Apple
  - Email/Password
- [ ] Data privacy compliance
 - Possibly consider GDPR/CCPA if relevant
 - Provide disclaimers for cannabis identification (respect local laws)
- [ ] User data encryption
  - SSL/TLS for data in transit, hashed passwords, secure DB connections
- [ ] Access control system
   - Roles: Admin, Expert, Standard User
   - Manage forum and community moderation

## Phase 7: Deployment & Scaling
### 7.1 Infrastructure
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline setup
   - Automated testing, linting, building, deployment (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
- [ ] Monitoring system
  - Track CPU/memory usage, errors, user metrics
- [ ] Auto-scaling configuration
  - Container orchestration (Docker + Kubernetes) if usage grows significantly
- [ ] Backup systems
 - Regular DB backups, replicated storage

### 7.2 Performance
- [ ] Load testing
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] CDN setup
- [ ] Cache implementation
  - Redis or similar to reduce repeated queries

## MVP Definition
Essential features for initial release:
1. Basic plant identification  (common garden plants and cannabis)
2. Disease detection for common issues (nutrient deficiencies, pests, fungal diseases)
3. Simple care recommendations (placeholder or rules-based)
4. User authentication (via OAuth or email/password)
5. Basic plant tracking (logging water/fertilizer events)
6. Mobile-friendly interface (Flutter app)

Once the MVP is stable, we’ll iterate toward more advanced features (weather integration, community, gamification).

## Future Enhancements
